Question 1: Point Class Operations
Create a Python class Point to represent a point in 2D space. Complete the following tasks:
- Distance Calculation
Given two points A(x₁, y₁) and B(x₂, y₂), calculate and print the distance between them.
- Midpoint Calculation
Calculate and print the midpoint between points A and B.
- Line Equation
Find the equation of the line passing through points A and B in the form y = mx + c, where m is the slope and c is the y-intercept.
- Reflection of Point
Given a third point C(x₃, y₃), calculate and print the coordinates of its reflection over the line passing through A and B.

Question 2: Vector Operations
Given three 2D vectors A⃗, B⃗, and C⃗, write a Python program using vector operations to perform:
- Vector Addition
Compute and print the resultant vector R⃗ = A⃗ + B⃗ + C⃗.
- Magnitude Calculation
Calculate and print the magnitude of each vector A⃗, B⃗, and C⃗.
- Dot Product
Calculate and print the dot product between each pair of vectors: A⃗·B⃗, A⃗·C⃗, and B⃗·C⃗.
- Angle Between Vectors
Calculate and print the angle (in degrees) between each pair of vectors: A⃗ & B⃗, A⃗ & C⃗, B⃗ & C⃗.
- Projection of Vector
Calculate and print the projection of vector A⃗ onto vector B⃗.

Question 3: Segment and Point Geometry
Given two points S(x₁, y₁) and E(x₂, y₂) forming a segment SE, and a third point P(x₃, y₃), write a Python program to:
- Distance of Segment
Calculate and print the length of segment SE.
- Closest Point on Segment
Determine and print the coordinates of the point on segment SE that is closest to point P.
- Distance from Point to Segment
Calculate and print the distance from point P to the closest point on segment SE.

Question 4: Line Intersection
Given two lines L₁ and L₂ defined by:
- Line L₁: a₁x + b₁y = c₁
- Line L₂: a₂x + b₂y = c₂
Write a Python program to:
- Check for Intersection
Determine if the lines intersect.
- Intersection Point
If they intersect, print the coordinates of the intersection point (x, y).
- Parallel or Coincident
If the lines are parallel or coincident, print: "Lines are parallel or coincident."
